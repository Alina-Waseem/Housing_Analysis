# Housing Data Story

So, I explored a housing dataset to understand the market better.  
On average, house prices are around ₹47 lakh, but when I looked closer, I noticed some houses are way more expensive — even over ₹1.3 crore!  
That really pulled the average up.  

Most homes are pretty normal, around 3 bedrooms and 4600 sq. ft., but there are also a few big luxury houses.  
These are the *outliers* that surprised me.  

While many houses are similar, there’s still a lot of variety in prices and sizes.  
This shows the market has both affordable and high-end options.  

It’s useful because it helps buyers know what’s normal and whether a price is fair or too high.
