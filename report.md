# Housing Data Story

So, I explored a housing dataset to understand the market better.

On average, house prices are around 47 lakh, but when I looked closer, I noticed some houses are way more expensive even over 1.3 crore! That really pulled the average up.

Most homes are pretty normal, around 3 bedrooms and 4600 sq. ft., but there are also a few big luxury houses. These are the outliers that stood out.

I also noticed that houses with more bedrooms and bigger area usually cost more, but not always — some smaller homes are still very expensive, probably because of their location or how well they are furnished.

When I checked the furnishing status, furnished houses generally had the highest prices, semi-furnished came in the middle, and unfurnished ones were usually the cheapest.

So overall, while many houses follow the same trend, there’s still a lot of variety in prices and features.

This shows the housing market has both affordable and high-end options. It’s useful because it helps buyers know what’s normal, what’s expensive, and whether a price is fair or too high.
